# What have I learned

Brief description of things I learned about

**Git merge conflicts**

- When your a merging code, GitHub won't know what to do if there is 2 pieces of code written on the same line
- It asks your permission on what it should do, change one of them or accept both of them

**What is Git Bash?**

- Git bash is git that's using the powershell 'Bash'
- Bash is the powershell used on Linus and Mac
- Finally learned what powershell Mosh was using
